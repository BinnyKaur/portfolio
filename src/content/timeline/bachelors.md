After scoring under 40000, from 1.3 million students, I got admission at one of the top colleges Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology. Thapar is ranked among top 30 colleges in India. My experience in college was very humbling and mind opening. I was living away from my parents for first time. It provided me wide-ranging of learning experiences and prepared me for my future in the corporate world. I also actively participated in extra-cirricular acitivities whenver I got time.
